## Data Sorting Visualized
Welcome to my Data Sorting Visualizer! I built this application purely using JavaScript (React). As a backend engineer, I was thrilled to learn more about sorting methods and how each would perform in terms of space and time complexity. Having to effectively visualize them really taught me the ins and outs of how each sorting method actually works. I hope you enjoy playing around with it as much as I did.
